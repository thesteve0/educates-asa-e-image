= educates-asa-e-image

Custom Image for the Educates platform. It pre-installs the AZ command line and a very simple spring project

Graham has already made https://github.com/vmware-tanzu-labs/educates-extension-packages/tree/main/packages/azure-cli[an image]
that download and installs the az command line

This images builds with a working 'az' in it.
Next steps
1. figure out the github action to build and push the action to the repo
2. change the line in my lab to pull that image
3. run it and see if we can get 'az' to work
